       I'm a Programmer, Graphic Designer, Ethical Hacker and a Web Developer. I created this website to help those who want to learn Python programming language, SQL and Ethical Hacking.
      My goal is to keep everything as simple to help everyone to get the understanding of every post in my article. You can reach me via all the handles at the footer page to give me 
      insight about anything you want to me to know or to add to my page to help it grow bigger and stronger and I would appreciate it very much.
   </p>
   <p>
      In this post we'll be learning all the three I have already mentioned earlier and keep it simple as I can. Python the most popular programming language for vast applications and easier for learning programming. SQL which can also be called Se-Quel is also a language for databases and Kali linux for hacking purposes.

        </div>
            <p><abbr title="Structured Query Language" style="text-decoration: underline;
                text-decoration-color: red; cursor: pointer;">SQL</abbr> is a computer language for storing, manupulating and retieveing data stored
                in a <abbr title="Relational DataBase" style="text-decoration: underline;
                text-decoration-color: red; cursor: pointer;">RDB</abbr> and its a standard language for <strong>Relational DataBase System</strong> (RDBMS).
We can also say that is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), 
or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).
<!-- source: <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" style="text-decoration: none;"><cite>wikipedia</cite></a>

                <p>SQL became the standard of the <abbr title="American National Standard Institute " ><strong style="text-decoration: underline;
                    text-decoration-color: red; cursor: pointer; ">ANSI </strong></abbr>in
                1986, and of the <strong>International Organization Standardization </strong>(ISO) in 1987.
            In this lesson I will be teaching MySQl as the as its my favourite RDBMS and it based on the SQL.</p>

            <h2>Python</h2>
        </div>

            <p><strong>Python</strong> is the most preferred programming language that every develop loves to work with.
                Python can be used for many purpose and most big companies like Youtube, Netflix, etc are using it for their daily tasks.
                What makes python the best for use is the easy and clean syntax that even someone without any programming knowledeg can read and understand. 
            </p>
           <p>Python is cross platform meaning which means the same code you write can be run on anywhere and at anytime.
               All the Os' support python so you don't need much to learn about this amazing language. Python is also a scripting language meaning
               it can be used write scripts ...

            <h2>Kali Linux</h2>

            <p><strong>Kali linux</strong> is an operating system for mostly preffered by <strong>Hackers.</strong>
                All the types of hackers use Kali though there are some linux based distros which are much easier to handle.
                Parrot, Ubuntu and others which comes with cool graphics and very easier to operate on.
                <br> In this article we will be not be focusing much on the history of Kali Linux. 
                But how to go about it, the installation, what to after installation, commands, and some cool tools which comes with Kali. 
          <p>
            Kali Linux can be used for many things, also in this lesson, I will be teaching some basic networking commands as you can't work with 
            Kali without knowing networking and ...
